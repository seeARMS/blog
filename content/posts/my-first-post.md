I'm a huge fan of productivity tools, especially when they allow me to automate certain things or organize things better.

This is a new beginning on my blog on hugo and this seems pretty cool so im adding random text here because I dont know **what** to add here. So im adding a lot more random text here.

    from faker import Fake
    randint(1, 2)
    
    destFile = "largedataset-" + timestart + ".txt"
    file_object = open(destFile,"a")
    file_object.write("uuid" + "," + "username" + "," + "name" + "," + "country" + "\n")
    
    def create_names(fake):
        for x in range(numberRuns):
            genUname = fake.slug()
            genName =  fake.first_name()
            genCountry = fake.country()
    file_object.write(genUname + "," + genName + "," + genCountry + "\n")
    ..

This is bash code:

\#!/usr/bin/env bash
var=""
echo "Hello, ${var}"
